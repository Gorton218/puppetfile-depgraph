## PRs with Conflicts (5)

### PR #131: Refactor buildNodeTree method to reduce cognitive complexity from 18 to 15
- **Branch**: copilot/fix-100
- **Conflict File**: src/dependencyTreeService.ts
- **Conflict Reason**: The buildNodeTree method has been significantly refactored in the target branch with new progress callback functionality and cancellation token support

### PR #127: Replace String.match() with RegExp.exec() in puppetfileParser.ts
- **Branch**: copilot/fix-109
- **Conflict File**: src/puppetfileParser.ts
- **Conflict Reason**: The parser code has been updated in the target branch, likely the same fix was already applied

### PR #114: Refactor buildNodeTree method to reduce cognitive complexity from 21 to 15
- **Branch**: copilot/fix-87
- **Conflict File**: src/dependencyTreeService.ts
- **Conflict Reason**: Similar to PR #131, conflicts with the new progress callback implementation

### PR #112: Replace logical OR operators with nullish coalescing operators for safer null/undefined handling
- **Branch**: copilot/fix-86
- **Conflict File**: src/dependencyTreeService.ts
- **Conflict Reason**: The code structure has changed in areas where the logical OR operators were to be replaced

### PR #110: Replace logical OR with nullish coalescing operator for safer type handling
- **Branch**: copilot/fix-88
- **Conflict Files**: Multiple files including dependencyTreeService.ts, puppetfileHoverProvider.ts, puppetfileParser.ts
- **Conflict Reason**: Widespread changes across multiple files conflict with updates in the target branch

## Next Steps

For the 5 PRs with conflicts, manual intervention is required:

1. Each PR author should checkout their branch and manually rebase
2. Resolve conflicts by understanding the changes in both branches
3. Many of these fixes might already be incorporated in the target branch
4. Consider closing PRs if the fixes are no longer needed

## Recommendations

1. **PR #127**: The String.match() to RegExp.exec() change might already be in the target branch - verify and potentially close
2. **PR #131 & #114**: Both attempt to refactor buildNodeTree - review if still needed given the new implementation
3. **PR #112 & #110**: Nullish coalescing operator changes - check if already applied in target branch
